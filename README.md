### What?

A desktop-in-container implementation.

### How?

By having an image with the least necessary to bootstrap a working productive environment using VNC.

### How to?

You should be able to build this (docker-only, sorry) image using build.sh. Then starting up locally via docker-compose using tchelinux.sh.

### Why?

This was a presentation for a local LUG on how to do things like this from scratch.
